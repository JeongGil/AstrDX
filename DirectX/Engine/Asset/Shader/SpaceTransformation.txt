Local Space:
The coordinate system relative to the model itself. These are the coordinates used when creating the mesh.

World Space:
The space in which the game runs. Objects in local space are transformed into world space using matrices.
Position, scale, and rotation can all be represented using matrices. Rotation can be expressed by combining rotations around the X, Y, and Z axes.
World Matrix = Scale Matrix * Self-Rotation Matrix * Translation Matrix * Orbit Rotation Matrix * Parent Matrix

View Space:
The coordinate system relative to the camera.
To place objects into view space, every object in world space is translated by the inverse of the camera’s position so that the camera becomes the origin (0, 0, 0).
Then they are rotated around the origin by the inverse of the camera’s rotation so that the camera looks toward the +Z direction.
A matrix is used to transform objects from world space into view space.

Projection Space:
The process of converting 3D into 2D. A matrix transforms objects in view space into projection space.
Vertex data in view space is transformed so that x and y become values between -1 and 1, and z becomes a value between 0 and 1.
This step applies perspective to prepare the scene for rendering. Two types of projection exist:

Perspective Projection: Applies perspective (objects farther away appear smaller).

Orthographic Projection: Maintains original size without perspective.
Anything outside x, y ∈ [-1, 1] or z ∈ [0, 1] is clipped.

===== Processes Handled Automatically by DirectX =====

Homogeneous Space (Clip / NDC Space):
The normalized coordinates actually used by the GPU.
After the projection transform, x and y fall between -1 and 1, and z falls between 0 and 1.
The w component holds the z-value from view space.
Coordinates (x, y, z, w) are divided by w:
x / w, y / w, z / w

Viewport Transform:
Converts NDC space into the 2D screen space defined when initializing DirectX.
For example, if the resolution is 1280×720, NDC values are transformed into the 0–1280, 0–720 screen coordinate space. This is the actual display coordinate system.
